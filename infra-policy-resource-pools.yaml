#
# Manifest for an infrastructure policy which uses two resource pools from
# two different vSphere clusters compute resources using the DSM Gateway API as Infra Admin
#
# Note: DSM 2.0 does not support using two resource pools from the same vSphere cluster
#
# You may need to make some changes for this to work on your own infrastructure
